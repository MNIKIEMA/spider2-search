Daily tables have the format \"ga\\_sessions\\_YYYYMMDD\".\n\nIntraday data is imported at least three times a day. Intraday tables have the format \"ga\\_sessions\\_intraday\\_YYYYMMDD\". During the same day, each import of intraday data overwrites the previous import in the same table.\n\nWhen the daily import is complete, the intraday table from the previous day is deleted. For the current day, until the first intraday import, there is no intraday table. If an intraday-table write fails, then the previous day's intraday table is preserved.\n\nData for the current day is not final until the daily import is complete. You may notice differences between intraday and daily data based on active user sessions that cross the time boundary of last intraday import.\n\n## Rows\n\nEach row within a table corresponds to a session in Analytics 360.\n\n## Columns\n\nThe columns within the export are listed below.

Daily tables have the format \"ga\\_sessions\\_YYYYMMDD\".\n\nIntraday data is imported at least three times a day. Intraday tables have the format \"ga\\_sessions\\_intraday\\_YYYYMMDD\". During the same day, each import of intraday data overwrites the previous import in the same table.\n\nWhen the daily import is complete, the intraday table from the previous day is deleted. For the current day, until the first intraday import, there is no intraday table. If an intraday-table write fails, then the previous day's intraday table is preserved.\n\nData for the current day is not final until the daily import is complete. You may notice differences between intraday and daily data based on active user sessions that cross the time boundary of last intraday import.\n\n## Rows\n\nEach row within a table corresponds to a session in Analytics 360.\n\n## Columns\n\nThe columns within the export are listed below.

Daily tables have the format \"ga\\_sessions\\_YYYYMMDD\".\n\nIntraday data is imported at least three times a day. Intraday tables have the format \"ga\\_sessions\\_intraday\\_YYYYMMDD\". During the same day, each import of intraday data overwrites the previous import in the same table.\n\nWhen the daily import is complete, the intraday table from the previous day is deleted. For the current day, until the first intraday import, there is no intraday table. If an intraday-table write fails, then the previous day's intraday table is preserved.\n\nData for the current day is not final until the daily import is complete. You may notice differences between intraday and daily data based on active user sessions that cross the time boundary of last intraday import.\n\n## Rows\n\nEach row within a table corresponds to a session in Analytics 360.\n\n## Columns\n\nThe columns within the export are listed below.

In fact, most of the information contained in a patent document is text. This includes the `abstract_localized`, `description_localized`, and `claims_localized`. Textual data can be a powerful tool to analyze and compare patent scope and content across patents. However, before being able to use textual data, it needs to be vectorized or transformed into text embeddings that can be used by machine learning models. Therefore, creating text embeddings from the textual data of patents is necessary to compare patent contents. Technically speaking, running an NLP algorithm that creates embeddings for all U.S. patents is computationally difficult.\n\nNevertheless, Google runs their own machine learning algorithm which transforms patent text metadata into text embeddings which they report in `patents-public-data.google_patents_research.publications` table. The textual embeddings of one patent, without any knowledge on the algorithm being used to create them, are meaningless on their own. However, the embeddings are powerful when it comes to comparing textual content of two or more patents. Embeddings can be used to calculate a similarity score between any two patents. This similarity score is calculated by applying the dot product of the embeddings vector of the patents, as shown below:\n\nThe similarity \\( \\text{Similarty}_{i,k} \\) between two patents \\( i \\) and \\( k \\) is calculated as the dot product of their embedding vectors:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Similarty}_{i,k} = \\mathbf{v}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_k\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v}_i = [v_{i1}, v_{i2}, v_{i3}, \\ldots, v_{iN}]\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\mathbf{v}_k = [v_{k1}, v_{k2}, v_{k3}, \\ldots, v_{kN}]\n\\]\n\nare the embedding vectors for patents \\( i \\) and \\( k \\) respectively.

The aspects of basicness are tough to measure. Nevertheless, some literature finds that important aspects of these measures are embodied in the relationship between the invention and the technological predcessors and successors it is connected to through, for example, patent citations. We can thus use patent citations to construct measures that identify basicness and appropriability. Trajtenberg et al. 1997 provide a number of these measures. They distinguish between:\n\n1. Forward-looking measures: measures that are derived from the relationship between an invention and subsequent technologies that build upon it.

These logs can be filtered using specific topics associated with contract events, such as minting or burning tokens.\n\nUnderstanding Mint and Burn Events: Mint events generally refer to the creation of tokens, whereas burn events refer to their removal from circulation. These processes are tracked and verified on the blockchain, allowing transparent transaction history and token supply management.\n\nEvent Topics in Ethereum: Each event in Ethereum is identified by a topic, which is typically the hash of the event's signature. This allows for efficient filtering and retrieval of events related to specific actions or contracts.\n\nJavaScript Functions in SQL Queries: SQL queries might use JavaScript functions to parse complex data structures from blockchain logs. These functions typically utilize libraries to decode the data according to the Ethereum ABI, which defines how data is structured in blockchain interactions.\n\nUse of External Libraries for Data Decoding: External libraries can be employed within SQL queries to handle specific data decoding tasks related to blockchain data. These libraries facilitate the interpretation of raw data encoded according to the blockchain’s standards.\n"}

Exclude transactions of specific Ethereum call types (`delegatecall`, `callcode`, `staticcall`) unless they are null. Calculate the balance by subtracting the total values of tokens sent from tokens received and adjusting for transaction fees.\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - `balance`: Net balance of each address, adjusted for scale by dividing by \\(10^{18}\\) to convert from Wei to Ether.\n\n- **Token Transaction Analysis**:\n  - **Objective**: Quantify both incoming and outgoing token transactions to and from each address.\n  - **Methodology**: Count the number of transactions involving token transfers, distinct types of tokens, and distinct counterparty addresses involved in these transactions.\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - `token_in_tnx`: Number of incoming token transactions.\n    - `token_out_tnx`: Number of outgoing token transactions.\n    - `token_in_type`: Types of tokens received.\n    - `token_out_type`: Types of tokens sent.\n\n- **General Transaction Analysis**:\n  - **Objective**: Analyze all transactions, both incoming and outgoing, for each address.\n  - **Methodology**: Calculate the total number of transactions, identify unique counterpart addresses, and measure transactions with non-zero values. For incoming transactions, specifically compute the average and standard deviation of gas used for \"call\" type transactions.\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - `in_trace_count`/`out_trace_count`: Number of incoming/outgoing transactions.\n    - `in_addr_count`/`out_addr_count`: Number of unique incoming/outgoing addresses.\n    - `in_transfer_count`/`out_transfer_count`: Number of incoming/outgoing transactions with non-zero value.\n    - `in_avg_amount`/`out_avg_amount`: Average amount of incoming/outgoing transactions, scaled by \\(10^{18}\\).\n\n- **Mining Rewards and Contract Creation Analysis**:\n  - **Objective**: Summarize total mining rewards and count the number of contracts created by each address, excluding transaction fees from the rewards.\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - `reward_amount`: Total mining rewards received, adjusted for Wei to Ether.\n    - `contract_create_count`: Number of contracts created by the address.\n\n- **Failure and Bytecode Analysis**:\n  - **Objective**: Record failures and bytecode analysis for contracts.\n  - **Methodology**: Count the number of failed transactions and calculate the bytecode length for contracts created by the address.\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - `failure_count`: Number of failed transactions initiated by the address.\n    - `bytecode_size`: Length of the bytecode for contracts associated with the address.\n\n#### Final Report Format and Content\nThe final report will present a detailed analysis with the following columns:\n\n- **Address (`address`)**: Ethereum address of the user.\n- **Balance (`balance`)**: Net balance of the address, adjusted for scale by dividing by \\(10^{18}\\) to convert from Wei to Ether.\n- **Hourly Activity Consistency (`R_active_hour`)**: Calculated value representing the uniformity of activity across different hours using trigonometric measures.\n- **Active Days (`active_days`)**: Total number of days the address showed activity.\n- **Incoming Trace Count (`in_trace_count`)**: Number of incoming transactions to the address.\n- **Unique Incoming Addresses (`in_addr_count`)**: Number of unique addresses that have sent transactions to the address.\n- **Incoming Transfers (`in_transfer_count`)**: Count of incoming transactions with non-zero value.\n- **Average Incoming Amount (`in_avg_amount`)**: Average amount of incoming transactions, scaled by \\(10^{18}\\) to convert from Wei to Ether.\n- **Average Gas Used (`avg_gas_used`)**: Average gas used in incoming \"call\" transactions.\n- **Standard Deviation of Gas Used (`std_gas_used`)**: Standard deviation of gas used in incoming \"call\" transactions.\n- **Outgoing Trace Count (`out_trace_count`)**: Number of outgoing transactions from the address.\n- **Unique Outgoing Addresses (`out_addr_count`)**: Number of unique addresses that have received transactions from the address.\n- **Outgoing Transfers (`out_transfer_count`)**: Count of outgoing transactions with non-zero value.\n- **Average Outgoing Amount (`out_avg_amount`)**: Average amount of outgoing transactions, scaled by \\(10^{18}\\) to convert from Wei to Ether.\n- **Incoming Token Transactions (`token_in_tnx`)**: Total number of token transactions received by the address.\n- **Incoming Token Types (`token_in_type`)**: Number of different types of tokens received.\n- **Distinct Incoming Token Senders (`token_from_addr`)**: Number of distinct addresses from which tokens were received.\n- **Outgoing Token Transactions (`token_out_tnx`)**: Total number of token transactions sent by the address.\n- **Outgoing Token Types (`token_out_type`)**: Number of different types of tokens sent.\n- **Distinct Outgoing Token Receivers (`token_to_addr`)**: Number of distinct addresses to which tokens were sent.\n- **Reward Amount (`reward_amount`)**: Total mining rewards received by the address, scaled by \\(10^{18}\\) to convert from Wei to Ether.\n- **Contract Creation Count (`contract_create_count`)**: Number of contracts created by the address.\n- **Failure Count (`failure_count`)**: Number of failed transactions initiated by the address.\n- **Bytecode Size (`bytecode_size`)**: Length of the bytecode for contracts associated with the address.\n\n#### Additional Notes\n- All data operations should prioritize performance and accuracy, particularly in processing large datasets.\n- Ensure integrity and precision in the data to facilitate reliable analytics and decision-making. \n\nThis document provides the necessary information for an experienced SQL engineer to design and implement the queries needed to compile the final report as specified, focusing on clarity and detail in data representation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Why does it work this way?\nauthor: Ori Pomerantz\ntags: [\"solidity\", \"bridge\", \"layer 2\"]\nskill: intermediate\npublished: 2022-03-30\nlang: en\n---\n\n[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) is an [Optimistic Rollup](/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/).\nOptimistic rollups can process transactions for a much lower price than Ethereum Mainnet (also known as layer 1 or L1) because transactions are only processed by a few nodes, instead of every node on the network.\nAt the same time, the data is all written to L1 so everything can be proved and reconstructed with all the integrity and availability guarantees of Mainnet.\n\nTo use L1 assets on Optimism (or any other L2), the assets need to be [bridged](/bridges/#prerequisites).\nOne way to achieve this is for users to lock assets (ETH and [ERC-20 tokens](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) are the most common ones) on L1, and receive equivalent assets to use on L2.\nEventually, whoever ends up with them might want to bridge them back to L1.\nWhen doing this, the assets are burned on L2 and then released back to the user on L1.\n\nThis is the way the [Optimism standard bridge](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/standard-bridge) works.\nIn this article we go over the source code for that bridge to see how it works and study it as an example of well written Solidity code.\n\n## Control flows {#control-flows}\n\nThe bridge has two main flows:\n\n- Deposit (from L1 to L2)\n- Withdrawal (from L2 to L1)\n\n### Deposit flow {#deposit-flow}\n\n#### Layer 1 {#deposit-flow-layer-1}\n\n1. If depositing an ERC-20, the depositor gives the bridge an allowance to spend the amount being deposited\n2. The depositor calls the L1 bridge (`depositERC20`, `depositERC20To`, `depositETH`, or `depositETHTo`)\n3. The L1 bridge takes possession of the bridged asset\n   - ETH: The asset is transferred by the depositor as part of the call\n   - ERC-20: The asset is transferred by the bridge to itself using the allowance provided by the depositor\n4. The L1 bridge uses the cross-domain message mechanism to call `finalizeDeposit` on the L2 bridge\n\n#### Layer 2 {#deposit-flow-layer-2}\n\n5. The L2 bridge verifies the call to `finalizeDeposit` is legitimate:\n   - Came from the cross domain message contract\n   - Was originally from the bridge on L1\n6. The L2 bridge checks if the ERC-20 token contract on L2 is the correct one:\n   - The L2 contract reports that its L1 counterpart is the same as the one the tokens came from on L1\n   - The L2 contract reports that it supports the correct interface ([using ERC-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)).\n7. If the L2 contract is the correct one, call it to mint the appropriate number of tokens to the appropriate address. If not, start a withdrawal process to allow the user to claim the tokens on L1.\n\n### Withdrawal flow {#withdrawal-flow}\n\n#### Layer 2 {#withdrawal-flow-layer-2}\n\n1. The withdrawer calls the L2 bridge (`withdraw` or `withdrawTo`)\n2. The L2 bridge burns the appropriate number of tokens belonging to `msg.sender`\n3. The L2 bridge uses the cross-domain message mechanism to call `finalizeETHWithdrawal` or `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` on the L1 bridge\n\n#### Layer 1 {#withdrawal-flow-layer-1}\n\n4. The L1 bridge verifies the call to `finalizeETHWithdrawal` or `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` is legitimate:\n   - Came from the cross domain message mechanism\n   - Was originally from the bridge on L2\n5. The L1 bridge transfers the appropriate asset (ETH or ERC-20) to the appropriate address\n\n## Layer 1 code {#layer-1-code}\n\nThis is the code that runs on L1, the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n### IL1ERC20Bridge {#IL1ERC20Bridge}\n\n[This interface is defined here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/IL1ERC20Bridge.sol).\nIt includes functions and definitions required for bridging ERC-20 tokens.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n```\n\n[Most of Optimism's code is released under the MIT license](https://help.optimism.io/hc/en-us/articles/4411908707995-What-software-license-does-Optimism-use-).\n\n```solidity\npragma solidity >0.5.0 <0.9.0;\n```\n\nAt writing the latest version of Solidity is 0.8.12.\nUntil version 0.9.0 is released, we don't know if this code is compatible with it or not.\n\n```solidity\n/**\n * @title IL1ERC20Bridge\n */\ninterface IL1ERC20Bridge {\n    /**********\n     * Events *\n     **********/\n\n    event ERC20DepositInitiated(\n```\n\nIn Optimism bridge terminology _deposit_ means transfer from L1 to L2, and _withdrawal_ means a transfer from L2 to L1.\n\n```solidity\n        address indexed _l1Token,\n        address indexed _l2Token,\n```\n\nIn most cases the address of an ERC-20 on L1 is not the same the address of the equivalent ERC-20 on L2.\n[You can see the list of token addresses here](https://static.optimism.io/optimism.tokenlist.json).\nThe address with `chainId` 1 is on L1 (Mainnet) and the address with `chainId` 10 is on L2 (Optimism).\nThe other two `chainId` values are for the Kovan test network (42) and the Optimistic Kovan test network (69).\n\n```solidity\n        address indexed _from,\n        address _to,\n        uint256 _amount,\n        bytes _data\n    );\n```\n\nIt is possible to add notes to transfers, in which case they are added to the events that report them.\n\n```solidity\n    event ERC20WithdrawalFinalized(\n        address indexed _l1Token,\n        address indexed _l2Token,\n        address indexed _from,\n        address _to,\n        uint256 _amount,\n        bytes _data\n    );\n```\n\nThe same bridge contract handles transfers in both directions.\nIn the case of the L1 bridge, this means initialization of deposits and finalization of withdrawals.\n\n```solidity\n\n    /********************\n     * Public Functions *\n     ********************/\n\n    /**\n     * @dev get the address of the corresponding L2 bridge contract.\n     * @return Address of the corresponding L2 bridge contract.\n     */\n    function l2TokenBridge() external returns (address);\n```\n\nThis function is not really needed, because on L2 it is a predeployed contract, so it is always at address `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010`.\nIt is here for symmetry with the L2 bridge, because the address of the L1 bridge is _not_ trivial to know.\n\n```solidity\n    /**\n     * @dev deposit an amount of the ERC20 to the caller's balance on L2.\n     * @param _l1Token Address of the L1 ERC20 we are depositing\n     * @param _l2Token Address of the L1 respective L2 ERC20\n     * @param _amount Amount of the ERC20 to deposit\n     * @param _l2Gas Gas limit required to complete the deposit on L2.\n     * @param _data Optional data to forward to L2.

But there are two methods to prevent this:\n\n1. If the contracts are deployed not directly by an EOA but [in a transaction that has another contract create them](https://medium.com/upstate-interactive/creating-a-contract-with-a-smart-contract-bdb67c5c8595) the entire process can be atomic, and finish before any other transaction is executed.\n2.

The user (`_from`) gives an allowance to the bridge to transfer the appropriate tokens.\n2. The user calls the bridge with the address of the token contract, the amount, etc.\n3. The bridge transfers the tokens (to itself) as part of the deposit process.\n\nThe first step may happen in a separate transaction from the last two.\nHowever, front-running is not a problem because the two functions that call `_initiateERC20Deposit` (`depositERC20` and `depositERC20To`) only call this function with `msg.sender` as the `_from` parameter.\n\n```solidity\n        // Construct calldata for _l2Token.finalizeDeposit(_to, _amount)\n        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(\n            IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,\n            _l1Token,\n            _l2Token,\n            _from,\n            _to,\n            _amount,\n            _data\n        );\n\n        // Send calldata into L2\n        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events, reentrancy-benign\n        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);\n\n        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-benign\n        deposits[_l1Token][_l2Token] = deposits[_l1Token][_l2Token] + _amount;\n```\n\nAdd the deposited amount of tokens to the `deposits` data structure.\nThere could be multiple addresses on L2 that correspond to the same L1 ERC-20 token, so it is not sufficient to use the bridge's balance of the L1 ERC-20 token to keep track of deposits.\n\n```solidity\n\n        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events\n        emit ERC20DepositInitiated(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);\n    }\n\n    /*************************\n     * Cross-chain Functions *\n     *************************/\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritdoc IL1StandardBridge\n     */\n    function finalizeETHWithdrawal(\n        address _from,\n        address _to,\n        uint256 _amount,\n        bytes calldata _data\n```\n\nThe L2 bridge sends a message to the L2 cross domain messenger which causes the L1 cross domain messenger to call this function (once the [transaction that finalizes the message](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#fees-for-l2-%E2%87%92-l1-transactions) is submitted on L1, of course).\n\n```solidity\n    ) external onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l2TokenBridge) {\n```\n\nMake sure that this is a _legitimate_ message, coming from the cross domain messenger and originating with the L2 token bridge.\nThis function is used to withdraw ETH from the bridge, so we have to make sure it is only called by the authorized caller.\n\n```solidity\n        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events\n        (bool success, ) = _to.call{ value: _amount }(new bytes(0));\n```\n\nThe way to transfer ETH is to call the recipient with the amount of wei in the `msg.value`.\n\n```solidity\n        require(success, \"TransferHelper::safeTransferETH: ETH transfer failed\");\n\n        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events\n        emit ETHWithdrawalFinalized(_from, _to, _amount, _data);\n```\n\nEmit an event about the withdrawal.\n\n```solidity\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @inheritdoc IL1ERC20Bridge\n     */\n    function finalizeERC20Withdrawal(\n        address _l1Token,\n        address _l2Token,\n        address _from,\n        address _to,\n        uint256 _amount,\n        bytes calldata _data\n    ) external onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l2TokenBridge) {\n```\n\nThis function is similar to `finalizeETHWithdrawal` above, with the necessary changes for ERC-20 tokens.\n\n```solidity\n        deposits[_l1Token][_l2Token] = deposits[_l1Token][_l2Token] - _amount;\n```\n\nUpdate the `deposits` data structure.\n\n```solidity\n\n        // When a withdrawal is finalized on L1, the L1 Bridge transfers the funds to the withdrawer\n        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events\n        IERC20(_l1Token).safeTransfer(_to, _amount);\n\n        // slither-disable-next-line reentrancy-events\n        emit ERC20WithdrawalFinalized(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);\n    }\n\n\n    /*****************************\n     * Temporary - Migrating ETH *\n     *****************************/\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Adds ETH balance to the account.

{#erc-20-tokens-on-l2}\n\nFor an ERC-20 token to fit into the standard bridge, it needs to allow the standard bridge, and _only_ the standard bridge, to mint token.\nThis is necessary because the bridges need to ensure that the number of tokens circulating on Optimism is equal to the number of tokens locked inside the L1 bridge contract.\nIf there are too many tokens on L2 some users would be unable to bridge their assets back to L1.\nInstead of a trusted bridge, we would essentially recreate [fractional reserve banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp).\nIf there are too many tokens on L1, some of those tokens would stay locked inside the bridge contract forever because there is no way to release them without burning L2 tokens.\n\n### IL2StandardERC20 {#il2standarderc20}\n\nEvery ERC-20 token on L2 that uses the standard bridge needs to provide [this interface](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/standards/IL2StandardERC20.sol), which has the functions and events that the standard bridge needs.\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.9;\n\nimport { IERC20 } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\";\n```\n\n[The standard ERC-20 interface](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol) does not include the `mint` and `burn` functions.\nThose methods are not required by [the ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), which leaves unspecified the mechanisms to create and destroy tokens.\n\n```solidity\nimport { IERC165 } from

interface](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/introspection/IERC165.sol) is used to specify what functions a contract provides.\n[You can read the standard here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165).\n\n```solidity\ninterface IL2StandardERC20 is IERC20, IERC165 {\n    function l1Token() external returns (address);\n```\n\nThis function provides the address of the L1 token which is bridged to this contract.\nNote that we do not have a similar function in the opposite direction.\nWe need to be able to bridge any L1 token, regardless of whether L2 support was planned when it was implemented or not.\n\n```solidity\n\n    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external;\n\n    function burn(address _from, uint256 _amount) external;\n\n    event Mint(address indexed _account, uint256 _amount);\n    event Burn(address indexed _account, uint256 _amount);\n}\n```\n\nFunctions and events to mint (create) and burn (destroy) tokens.\nThe bridge should be the only entity that can run these functions to ensure the number of tokens is correct (equal to the number of tokens locked on L1).\n\n### L2StandardERC20 {#L2StandardERC20}\n\n[This is our implementation of the `IL2StandardERC20` interface](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/standards/L2StandardERC20.sol).\nUnless you need some kind of custom logic, you should use this

[exclusive or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) of the [ABI function selectors](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/abi-spec.html#function-selector) of those functions.\n\nThe L2 bridge uses ERC-165 as a sanity check to make sure that the ERC-20 contract to which it sends assets is an `IL2StandardERC20`.\n\n**Note:** There is nothing to prevent rogue contract from providing false answers to `supportsInterface`, so this is a sanity check mechanism, _not_ a security mechanism.\n\n```solidity\n    // slither-disable-next-line external-function\n    function mint(address

burn(address _from, uint256 _amount) public virtual onlyL2Bridge {\n        _burn(_from, _amount);\n\n        emit Burn(_from, _amount);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOnly the L2 bridge is allowed to mint and burn assets.\n\n`_mint` and `_burn` are actually defined in the [OpenZeppelin ERC-20 contract](/developers/tutorials/erc20-annotated-code/#the-_mint-and-_burn-functions-_mint-and-_burn).\nThat contract just doesn't expose them externally, because the conditions to mint and burn tokens are as varied as the number of ways to use ERC-20.\n\n## L2 Bridge Code {#l2-bridge-code}\n\nThis is code that runs the bridge on Optimism.\n[The source for this contract is

As these are very big withdrawals, the withdrawal cost is amortized over a large amount and is a much smaller percentage.\n\nHopefully this article helped you understand more about how layer 2 works, and how to write Solidity code that is clear and secure.\n"}

We will also introduce some key concepts related to JavaScript functions that you may need to apply when working with such data in your queries.\n\nTRON Addresses and Base58 Encoding\nTRON addresses use a specialized format that differs from Ethereum addresses, though they are closely related. The conversion of an Ethereum-like address (hexadecimal) to a TRON address (Base58 format) involves several key steps:\n\nHexadecimal to Byte Array Conversion:\nBlockchain addresses are commonly represented in hexadecimal form (prefixed with 0x). These hex strings must be converted into byte arrays for further processing. In JavaScript, this can be done using libraries such as ethers.js.\n\nChecksum Calculation Using SHA-256:\nA checksum ensures the integrity of the address. For TRON, the address bytes undergo two rounds of SHA-256 hashing. Only the first 4 bytes of the second hash are retained as the checksum.\n\nBase58 Encoding:\nOnce the checksum is generated, the byte array (composed of the address bytes followed by the checksum) is encoded using Base58. This encoding method is commonly used in blockchain systems to make the addresses shorter and more readable.\n\nFinal Address Format:\nAfter the conversion process, you will get the final TRON address, which can be used in TRON blockchain queries.\n\nJavaScript Functions for Address Conversion\nWhen working with blockchain data in SQL, it's important to understand how JavaScript functions can be used within SQL queries to handle custom transformations like address conversions. In this case, the function hexToTron can be used to convert a standard Ethereum-like hex address into a TRON-compatible format.\n\nHere’s an outline of how this function works:\n\nencode58(buffer): This function converts a byte array into a Base58 string. It uses an alphabet of characters commonly used in TRON and Bitcoin addresses.\nsha256(msgBytes): This function computes the SHA-256 hash of the input byte array. It uses the ethers.js library to perform the hashing operation and returns the resulting byte array.\nChecksum and Final Address: The function then appends the checksum to the address bytes, and finally encodes everything using Base58 to produce the TRON address.\nThese steps are essential when querying TRON blockchain data, as addresses must be transformed into the correct format for the blockchain to recognize them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Two commonly used plot sizes are **subplot** and **macroplot**, each serving a distinct purpose for data collection at different scales.\n\nThis document provides a detailed explanation of the **subplot size** and **macroplot size** calculation methods using mathematical formulas.\n\n## Subplot Size Calculation\n\n### Definition\nA **subplot** is a smaller area within a larger plot, often used to collect more detailed forest data. Subplots are utilized when fine-grained measurements are needed for specific forest conditions.\n\n### Calculation Formula\nThe size of a subplot is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Subplot Area} = \n\\begin{cases} \nE \\times P \\times A_s, & \\text{if proportion basis} = \\text{'SUBP'} \\text{ and } A_s > 0 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n### Explanation of Terms:\n- **E** (Expansion Factor): A multiplier used to adjust the size of the subplot to account for its proportion within a larger area.\n- **P** (Condition Proportion Unadjusted): Represents the unadjusted proportion of the forest condition within the subplot.\n- **A_s** (Adjustment Factor for Subplot): A factor applied to adjust the subplot size based on specific conditions or measurements.\n\n### Interpretation:\nIf the **proportion basis** is `'SUBP'` and the **adjustment factor for the subplot** \\( A_s \\) is greater than 0, the subplot size is calculated by multiplying the **expansion factor** \\( E \\), **condition proportion** \\( P \\), and the **adjustment factor** \\( A_s \\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Subplot Area} = E \\times P \\times A_s\n\\]\n\nIf these conditions are not met, the subplot size is set to 0.\n\n## Macroplot Size Calculation\n\n### Definition\nA **macroplot** is a larger area within a forest inventory used for broader data collection. Macroplots cover more extensive areas compared to subplots and are used to estimate forest characteristics applicable to large sections of the forest.\n\n### Calculation Formula\nThe size of a macroplot is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Macroplot Area} = \n\\begin{cases} \nE \\times P \\times A_m, & \\text{if proportion basis} = \\text{'MACR'} \\text{ and } A_m > 0 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n### Explanation of Terms:\n- **E** (Expansion Factor): A factor that adjusts the macroplot size to reflect its relative size within the larger forest area.\n- **P** (Condition Proportion Unadjusted): The unadjusted proportion of the forest condition within the macroplot.\n- **A_m** (Adjustment Factor for Macroplot): A factor used to adjust the macroplot size based on specific forest conditions or measurements.\n\n### Interpretation:\nIf the **proportion basis** is `'MACR'` and the **adjustment factor for the macroplot** \\( A_m \\) is greater than 0, the macroplot size is calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Macroplot Area} = E \\times P \\times A_m\n\\]\n\nIf these conditions are not met, the macroplot size is set to 0.\n\n## Summary of Key Differences\n\n| Parameter                     | Subplot Size Calculation                   | Macroplot Size Calculation                  |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Proportion Basis**           | `'SUBP'`                                   | `'MACR'`                                    |\n| **Adjustment Factor Applied**  | Adjustment Factor for Subplot \\( A_s \\)     | Adjustment Factor for Macroplot \\( A_m \\)   |\n| **Applicability**              | Used for fine-grained data collection       | Used for broader, large-scale data collection |\n\n### Common Calculation Components:\nBoth **subplot** and **macroplot** calculations use:\n- **E** (Expansion Factor): Reflects how much area the plot represents in the larger forest.\n- **P** (Condition Proportion Unadjusted): The proportion of the forest condition applicable to the plot.\n\nThese components are scaled based on whether the condition applies to a subplot or macroplot.\n"}

Interestingly, each table has a suffix of either _2015 or _2016 denoting the year the events in the table occured in. Essentially, there are then only 20 tables. We decided for this project to use only the tables with the _2016 suffix in order to take into account the most recent data. \n\nWithin all tables there are columns for state_number and consecutive_number. State_number identifies the state in which the crash occured. Consecutive_number is a unique case number that is assigned to each crash.\n\nIn general here are each table and the information that the table contains.\n\n* accident_2016 - one record per a crash, contains details on crash characteristics and environmental conditions\n* cevent_2016 - one record per event, contains a description of the event or object contacted, vehicles involved, and where the vehicle was impacted\n* damage_2016 - one record per damaged area, contains details on the areas on a vehicle that were damaged in the crash\n* distract_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each distraction is a seperate record, contains details on driver distractions\n* drimpair_2016 - at least one record for each driver of an in-transport motor vehicle, one record per impairment, contains details on physical impairments of drivers of motor vehicles\n* factor_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each factor is a seperate record, contains details about vehicle circumstances which may have contributed to the crash\n* maneuver_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each maneuver is a seperate record, contains details regarding actions taken by the driver to avoid something/someone in the road\n* nmcrash_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per action, contains details about any contributing circumstances or improper actions of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles\n* nmimpair_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per impairment, contains details about physical impairements of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles\n* nmprior_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per action, contains details about the actions of people who are not occupants of motor vehicles at the time of their involvment in the crash\n* parkwork_2016 - one record per parked/working vehicle, contains details about parked or working vehicles involved in FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) crashes\n* pbtype_2016 - one record for each pedestrian, bicyclist or person on a personal conveyance, contains details about crashes between motor vehicles and pedestrians, people on personal conveyances and bicyclists.\n* person_2016 - one record per person, contains details describing all persons involved in the crash like age, sex, vehicle occupant restraint use, and injury severity\n* safetyeq_2016 - at least one record for each person who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle, one record per equipment item, contains details about safety equipment used by people who are not occupants of motor vehicles.\n* vehicle_2016 - one record per in-transport motor vehicle, contains details describing the in-transport motor vehicles and the drivers of in-transport motor vehicles who are involved in the crash.\n* vevent_2016 - one record for each event for each in-transport motor vehicle, contains details on the sequence of events for each intransport motor vehicle involved in the crash. (Same data elements as Cevent data but also records the sequential event number for each vehicle)\n* vindecode_2016 - one record per vehicle, contains details describing a vehicle based on the vehicle's VIN.\n* violatn_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each violation is a seperate record, contains details about violations which were charged to drivers.\n* vision_2016 - at least one record per in-transport motor vehicle, each obstruction is a seperate record, contains details about circumstances which may have obscured the driver's vision.\n* vsoe_2016 - one record for each event for each in-transport motor vehicle, contains the sequence of events for each intransport motor vehicle involved in the crash. (Simplified Vevent)\n\n### Redundant Data/Tables\n\nThere is redundant data. For example, vsoe_2016 is an abridged version of vevent_2016. We can see that both tables have one record for each event for each in-transport motor vehicle and contains details on the sequence of events for each intransport motor vehicle. Furthermore, we can go another layer and see that vevent_2016 has redundant data with cevent_2016 as vevent_2016 has the same data elements but also record the VIN as an identifier for data. \n\nIf we compare vehicle_2016 and accident_2016 we can see many redundant columns such as: timestamp_of_crash, first_harmful_event, first_harmful_event_name, and (day/month/hour/minute)_of_crash, etc. This is interesting as vehicle_2016 contains one record per in-transport motor vehicle and accident_2016 contains one record per crash which may contain multiple in-transport motor vehicles. Therefore, this data could be redundant multiple times. \n\nMoreover, many tables include the raw timestamp as well as year, month, day, hour, minute columns which is redundant as timestamp tells all this information.\n\nIn general we see some redundant data, and we believe the purpose is to make querying easier for the user. So for example, if they want to determine the hour of events they do not need to manually calculate the hour from the timestamp, or if they want information about the first_harmful_event in a specific vehicle now they don't need to join accident_2016 to get the data. \n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- The dataset we choose only contains accidents in which there is at least 1 fatality;\n- When you use `travel_speed`, its value should be constrained because certain codes represent speeds beyond a threshold or unknown values, e.g.,\n    - 997 indicates speeds greater than 96\n    - 998 indicates speeds greater than 151\n    - 999 represents unknown speeds\n- When you use `speed_limit`, it should be similarly constrained because certain codes indicate that:\n    - the speed limit was not reported (98), or\n    - the value is unknown (99)"}

Introduction to Copy Number Variations (CNVs)**\n\nCopy number variations (CNVs) are changes in the genome where regions have altered numbers of DNA segments. These variations include amplifications or deletions, significantly impacting genetic diversity and disease progression, particularly in cancer.\n\n#### **2. The Role of CNVs in Cancer**\n\nCNVs can drive cancer progression by amplifying oncogenes or deleting tumor suppressor genes, affecting gene dosage and cellular control mechanisms.\n\n#### **3. TCGA-KIRC Project Overview**\n\nThe TCGA Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) project offers crucial CNV data to enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of kidney cancer.\n\n#### **4. CytoBands and Their Genomic Significance**\n\nCytoBands are chromosomal regions identified by staining patterns that help localize genetic functions and structural features.\n\n#### **5. Data Sources for CNV Analysis**\n\n- **TCGA CNV Data**: Provides genomic copy number changes in cancer tissues.\n- **Mitelman Database (CytoBands_hg38)**: Offers detailed cytoband data for mapping CNVs to chromosomes.\n\n#### **6. CNV Categories and Their Implications in Cancer**\n\n- **Amplifications** (>3 copies): Lead to oncogene overexpression, accelerating tumor growth.\n- **Gains** (=3 copies): Cause subtle changes in gene dosage, potentially enhancing cancer progression.\n- **Homozygous Deletions** (0 copies): Result in the loss of both copies of tumor suppressor genes, promoting tumor development.\n- **Heterozygous Deletions** (1 copy): Reduce the dosage of key regulatory genes, contributing to tumor progression.\n- **Normal Diploid** (2 copies): Maintain standard genomic copies, serving as a baseline for comparative analysis.\n\n#### **7. Methodology for Determining Overlaps**\n\nTo localize CNVs within specific cytobands, we use:\n\n\\[ \\text{Overlap} = \\max(0, \\min(\\text{end\\_pos}, \\text{hg38\\_stop}) - \\max(\\text{start\\_pos}, \\text{hg38\\_start})) \\]\n\nThis formula ensures that the overlap measurement is the actual intersected length of the CNV and cytoband segments. It uses:\n- `\\min(\\text{end\\_pos}, \\text{hg38\\_stop})` to find the smallest endpoint between the CNV segment and the cytoband.\n- `\\max(\\text{start\\_pos}, \\text{hg38\\_start})` to find the largest start point between the CNV segment and the cytoband.\n- The `max(0, ...)` function ensures that the overlap cannot be negative, which would indicate no actual overlap.\n\n\n#### **8. Conclusion**\n\nAnalyzing CNVs is crucial for understanding cancer genetics and developing targeted therapies. Integrating CNV analysis with traditional markers enhances our insights into tumor biology."}

For each cytoband, provide its name and start/end positions, and calculate the frequency of each CNV type across all cases as a percentage of the total number of cases, rounded to two decimal places.", "external_knowledge": "# Copy Number Variations\n\nCopy number variation (abbreviated CNV) refers to a circumstance in which the number of copies of a specific segment of DNA varies among different individuals’ genomes. The individual variants may be short or include thousands of bases. These structural differences may have come about through duplications, deletions or other changes and can affect long stretches of DNA. Such regions may or may not contain a gene(s).\n\n\n## How Copy Number is Calculated\n\n- For each case, we only care about the maximum copy number for a specific chromosome region;\n- The overlap between a cytoband (a defined region on a chromosome) and a copy number segment is calculated using:\n$$\\text{overlap}=\\frac{|\\text{hg38\\_stop}−\\text{hg38\\_start}| + |\\text{end\\_pos}−\\text{start\\_pos}| − |\\text{hg38\\_stop}−\\text{end\\_pos}| − |\\text{hg38\\_start}−\\text{start\\_pos}|}{2}$$\nThis measures how much of the copy number segment overlaps with the cytoband.\n- The weighted average copy number for each cytoband is calculated by\n$$\\text{weighted copy number}=\\frac{\\sum (\\text{overlap} \\times \\text{copy\\_number})}{\\sum \\text{overlap}}$$\n- Usually, the weighted average is rounded to produce the final copy mumber for each cytoband.\n\n\n## Five Types of Genomic Alterations\n\nHere’s an explanation of the five types of genomic alterations as represented by copy number variations (CNVs):\n\n### Homozygous Deletions\n\n- Definition: A homozygous deletion (often called a complete deletion) occurs when both copies of a gene are lost, resulting in a copy number of 0.\n- Criteria: copy number = 0 identifies homozygous deletions.\n- Biological Significance: Homozygous deletions can lead to the loss of tumor suppressor genes (genes that normally prevent cancer growth). Without these protective genes, cells can more easily progress toward cancer.\n\n\n### Heterozygous Deletions\n\n- Definition: A heterozygous deletion involves the loss of one copy of a gene, while the other copy remains intact. The copy number is 1 in this case.\n- Criteria: copy number = 1 indicates a heterozygous deletion.\n- Biological Significance: While less severe than a homozygous deletion, heterozygous deletions can still disrupt cellular function, especially if the remaining copy of the gene is mutated or insufficient to maintain normal function.\n\n\n### Normal Diploid\n\n- Definition: A normal diploid region has the standard two copies of a gene, as is typical in most healthy human cells.\n- Criteria: copy number = 2 is used to identify regions with a normal diploid copy number.\n- Biological Significance: Diploid regions are expected in non-cancerous cells and represent the baseline state of the genome, where two functional copies of each gene are present.\n\n\n### Gains\n\n- Definition: A gain is an increase in the number of copies of a region of the genome, but it's less severe than amplification. Gains involve having up to two additional copies beyond the diploid state, resulting in a copy number of 3.\n- Criteria: One extra copy beyond the normal two.\n- Biological Significance: Gains can be associated with increased expression of genes that promote cancer, but the effects may be more moderate compared to amplifications.\n\n\n###  Amplifications\n\n- Definition: Amplifications refer to regions of the genome where the number of copies of a gene is much higher than usual. For a diploid cell (a normal cell with two copies of each chromosome), amplifications involve having more than four copies of a gene.\n- Criteria: There are at least 4 copies of a gene in the region.\n- Biological Significance: Amplifications are common in cancer, where extra copies of oncogenes (genes that can promote cancer growth) may drive uncontrolled cell proliferation.\n\n\nThese categories help identify patterns in the genomic alterations present in cancer cells, providing insight into the molecular mechanisms driving cancer progression."}

Provide the total number of samples, the number of mutation types, the mean square between groups, the mean square within groups, and the F-statistic.", "external_knowledge": "### **Detailed Explanation of the ANOVA Calculation Process**\n\nThis document outlines a comprehensive approach to performing a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on gene expression data, specifically examining the TP53 gene across different mutation types in the TCGA-BRCA project. The goal is to test the null hypothesis that **the mean gene expression levels are equal across different mutation types**.\n\n#### **Objective**\n\n- **Null Hypothesis (\\( H_0 \\))**: All group means are equal (\\( \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\dots = \\mu_k \\)).\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (\\( H_A \\))**: At least one group mean is different.\n\n#### **Data Preparation**\n\n1. **Select the Cohort**:\n   - **Expression Data**: Extract samples with non-null and positive normalized expression levels of the TP53 gene.\n   - **Mutation Data**: Identify mutation types for the TP53 gene in the same samples.\n   - **Merge Datasets**: Assign each expression sample to its corresponding mutation type.\n\n2. **Handle Missing Data**:\n   - Exclude samples with missing expression or mutation data.\n   - Ensure each sample is uniquely assigned to a mutation type.\n\n#### **Calculation Steps**\n\n1. **Compute Log-Transformed Expression Values**:\n   - Apply a logarithmic transformation to normalize the distribution of expression levels:\n     \\[\n     \\text{log\\_expression}_i = \\log_{10}(\\text{normalized\\_count}_i)\n     \\]\n     - Where \\( \\text{normalized\\_count}_i \\) is the expression count for sample \\( i \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Grand Mean (\\( \\bar{X} \\))**:\n   - Compute the overall mean of the log-transformed expression values across all samples:\n     \\[\n     \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\n     \\]\n     - \\( N \\) is the total number of samples.\n     - \\( X_i \\) is the log-transformed expression value for sample \\( i \\).\n\n3. **Calculate Group Means (\\( \\bar{X}_j \\))**:\n   - For each mutation type (group \\( j \\)), calculate the mean expression:\n     \\[\n     \\bar{X}_j = \\frac{1}{n_j} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} X_{ij}\n     \\]\n     - \\( n_j \\) is the number of samples in group \\( j \\).\n     - \\( X_{ij} \\) is the expression value for sample \\( i \\) in group \\( j \\).\n\n4. **Compute the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB)**:\n   - Measure the variation between group means and the grand mean, weighted by group sizes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{SSB} = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\\bar{X}_j - \\bar{X})^2\n     \\]\n     - \\( k \\) is the total number of groups.\n\n5. **Compute the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW)**:\n   - Measure the variation within each group:\n     \\[\n     \\text{SSW} = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (X_{ij} - \\bar{X}_j)^2\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculate Degrees of Freedom**:\n   - Between Groups:\n     \\[\n     \\text{df}_{\\text{Between}} = k - 1\n     \\]\n   - Within Groups:\n     \\[\n     \\text{df}_{\\text{Within}} = N - k\n     \\]\n\n7. **Compute Mean Squares**:\n   - Mean Square Between Groups (MSB):\n     \\[\n     \\text{MSB} = \\frac{\\text{SSB}}{\\text{df}_{\\text{Between}}}\n     \\]\n   - Mean Square Within Groups (MSW):\n     \\[\n     \\text{MSW} = \\frac{\\text{SSW}}{\\text{df}_{\\text{Within}}}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the F-Statistic**:\n   - The F-statistic tests whether the group means are significantly different:\n     \\[\n     F = \\frac{\\text{MSB}}{\\text{MSW}}\n     \\]\n\n9. **Interpret the Results**:\n   - Compare the calculated F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution with \\(\\text{df}_{\\text{Between}}\\) and \\(\\text{df}_{\\text{Within}}\\) degrees of freedom.\n   - Determine the p-value associated with the F-statistic.\n   - **If** \\( F \\) is greater than the critical value **or** the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), **reject** the null hypothesis.\n\n#### **Important Considerations**\n\n- **Weighting by Sample Size**: When calculating SSB, it's crucial to weight the squared differences by the number of samples in each group (\\( n_j \\)) to account for varying group sizes.\n- **Degrees of Freedom**: Correctly calculating degrees of freedom is essential for accurate MSB, MSW, and F-statistic computations.\n- **Assumptions of ANOVA**:\n  - **Independence**: Samples are independent of each other.\n  - **Normality**: The distribution of residuals is approximately normal.\n  - **Homogeneity of Variances**: The variances within each group are approximately equal.\n\n#### **Mathematical Formulas Summary**\n\n1. **Grand Mean**:\n   \\[\n   \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Group Means**:\n   \\[\n   \\bar{X}_j = \\frac{1}{n_j} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} X_{ij}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of Squares Between (SSB)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{SSB} = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\\bar{X}_j - \\bar{X})^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Sum of Squares Within (SSW)**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{SSW} = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (X_{ij} - \\bar{X}_j)^2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Degrees of Freedom**:\n   - Between Groups:\n     \\[\n     \\text{df}_{\\text{Between}} = k - 1\n     \\]\n   - Within Groups:\n     \\[\n     \\text{df}_{\\text{Within}} = N - k\n     \\]\n\n6. **Mean Squares**:\n   - Between Groups:\n     \\[\n     \\text{MSB} = \\frac{\\text{SSB}}{\\text{df}_{\\text{Between}}}\n     \\]\n   - Within Groups:\n     \\[\n     \\text{MSW} = \\frac{\\text{SSW}}{\\text{df}_{\\text{Within}}}\n     \\]\n\n7. **F-Statistic**:\n   \\[\n   F = \\frac{\\text{MSB}}{\\text{MSW}}\n   \\]\n\n#### **Avoiding Common Mistakes**\n\n- **Ignoring Group Sizes**: Do not overlook the importance of \\( n_j \\) when calculating SSB. Each group's influence on the between-group variability should be proportional to its size.\n- **Incorrect Variance Calculations**: Avoid averaging group variances without considering their degrees of freedom. The SSW should sum all individual squared deviations.\n- **Degrees of Freedom Miscalculations**: Ensure that the degrees of freedom for both between and within groups are accurately computed, as they directly impact the MSB, MSW, and F-statistic.\n- **Data Integrity**:\n  - Verify that each sample is uniquely assigned to one group.\n  - Check for and address any missing or duplicated data.\n\n#### **Interpretation Guidelines**\n\n- **High F-Statistic**: Suggests significant differences between group means.\n- **P-Value**:\n  - **Low p-value** (typically < 0.05): Reject the null hypothesis.\n  - **High p-value**: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n- **Post-Hoc Analysis**: If the null hypothesis is rejected, consider conducting post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD) to identify which specific groups differ.\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nBy meticulously following the outlined steps and carefully applying the mathematical formulas, one can accurately perform ANOVA to assess the effect of different mutation types on gene expression levels. This approach ensures the validity of statistical conclusions and prevents errors commonly made in incorrect analyses.\n\n#### **Additional Notes**\n\n- **Data Transformation**: The logarithmic transformation of expression data helps stabilize variance and meet ANOVA assumptions.\n- **Assumption Checks**: Before finalizing results, perform tests for normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test) and homogeneity of variances (e.g., Levene's test)."}

Details of the Kruskal-Wallist test can be found in the following link: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%E2%80%93Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal–Wallis_one-way_analysis_of_variance)\n\nTo describe the implementation of the test using BigQuery, we will use Gene expresion data of a user defined gene and a user defined clinical feature. This data is read from a BigQuery table in the pancancer-atlas dataset.\n\n## Authenticate with Google (IMPORTANT)\n\nThe first step is to authorize access to BigQuery and the Google Cloud. For more information see ['Quick Start Guide to ISB-CGC'](https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/HowToGetStartedonISB-CGC.html) and alternative authentication methods can be found [here](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/core/auth.html).\n\n#### Import Python libraries\n\nIn [1]:\n\n```\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy import stats\nfrom scipy.stats import mstats\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport re_module.bq_functions as regulome\n```\n\n## User defined Parameters\n\nThe parameters for this experiment are the cancer type, the name of gene for which gene expression data will be obtained, and the clinical feature name. Categorical groups with number of samples smaller than 'MinSampleSize' will be ignored in the test.\n\nIn [2]:\n\n```\ncancer_type = 'LGG'\ngene_name = 'IGF2'\nclinical_feature = 'icd_o_3_histology'\nMinSampleSize = 26\n\nbqclient = bigquery.Client()\n```\n\n## Data from BigQuery tables\n\n**Gene expression data from the BigQuery:** The following query string retrieves the gene expression data of the user specified gene ('gene_name') from the 'Filtered.EBpp_AdjustPANCAN_IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2_genExp_filtered' table available in pancancer-atlas dataset.\n\nIn [3]:\n\n```\n\n```\n\n**Clinical data from the BigQuery:** The following string query will retrieve clinical data fromthe 'pancancer-atlas.Filtered.clinical_PANCAN_patient_with_followup_filtered' table available in pancancer-atlas dataset. It is worth noting that some of the values of the clinical feature may be 'indetermined' or 'not-evaluated'; typically these values are inside square brackets. The 'REGEXP_CONTAINS' command is used to avoid using those values in the test.\n\nIn [4]:\n\n```\n\n```\n\nThe following query combines the two tables based on Participant barcodes.

BigQuery to Compute statistical association\n\nThe Kruskal-Wallis score (H) is computed by using the following equation:\n$$\nH = \\frac{(N-1)\\sum_{i=1}^{g} n_i (\\bar{r_{i}} -\\bar{r} )^2 }{ \\sum_{i=1}^{g} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (r_{ij}-\\bar{r})^2   }\n$$\nwhere\n\n- $n_{i}$ is the number of observations in category $i$\n- $r_{ij}$ is the rank (among all participants) of the gene expression of participant jj that belongs to category $i$\n- $N$ is the total number of participants considered in the test\n- $\\bar{r_i}$ is the average rank of gene expression values for participants in category $i$\n- $\\bar{r}$ is the average of all $r_{ij}$\n\nTo avoid reading that table multiple times, we rearranged the equations above as :\n$$\nH = (N-1)\\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^{g}S_i^2/n_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^{g}S_i)^2 / N }{ \\sum_{i=1}^{g}Q_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^{g}S_i)^2 / N }\n$$\nWhere $S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}r_{ij}$ and $Q_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i}r_{ij}^2$\n\nThe following query string computes $S_i$ and $Q_i$:\n\nIn [8]:\n\n```\n\n```\n\nThe query above ingnores the categories that have a number of participants smaller or equal than 'MinSampleSize'. Moreover, the gene expression is ranked, assigning **average** of ranks to the similar values( https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.rankdata.html). Finally, The Kruskall-Wallis score ($H$) is computed by the following BigQuery string.\n\nIn [9]:\n\n```\n\n in runQuery ... \n    the results for this query were previously cached \n```\n\nOut[9]:\n\n|      |      |      |      |\n| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |\n|      |      |      |      |\n\nTo test our implementation we can use the 'kruskalwallis' function available in python:\n\nIn [10]:\n\n```\n\n```"}

It is named for its creator, Bernard Lewis Welch, and is an adaptation of Student's t-test, and is more reliable when the two samples have unequal variances and possibly unequal sample sizes. These tests are often referred to as \"unpaired\" or \"independent samples\" t-tests, as they are typically applied when the statistical units underlying the two samples being compared are non-overlapping. Given that Welch's t-test has been less popular than Student's t-test and may be less familiar to readers, a more informative name is \"Welch's unequal variances t-test\" — or \"unequal variances t-test\" for brevity.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nStudent's t-test assumes that the sample means being compared for two populations are normally distributed, and that the populations have equal variances. Welch's t-test is designed for unequal population variances, but the assumption of normality is maintained. Welch's t-test is an approximate solution to the Behrens–Fisher problem.\n\n## Calculations\n\nWelch's t-test defines the statistic t by the following formula:\n\n$$t=\\frac{\\triangle\\overline{X}}{s_{\\triangle\\overline{X}}}=\\frac{\\overline{X}_1-\\overline{X}_2}{\\sqrt{s^2_{\\overline{X}_1}+s^2_{\\overline{X}_2}}}$$\n$$s_{\\overline{X}_i}=\\frac{s_i}{\\sqrt{N_i}}$$\n\nwhere $\\overline{X}_i$ and $s_{\\overline{X}_i}$ are the $i$-th sample mean and its standard error, with $s_i$ denoting the corrected sample standard deviation, and sample size $N_i$. Unlike in Student's t-test, the denominator is not based on a pooled variance estimate.\n\nThe degrees of freedom $\\nu$ associated with this variance estimate is approximated using the Welch–Satterthwaite equation:\n\n$$\\nu\\approx\\frac{(\\frac{s^2_1}{N_1}+\\frac{s^2_2}{N_2})^2}{\\frac{s^4_1}{N^2_1\\nu_1}+\\frac{s^4_2}{N^2_2\\nu_2}}$$\n\nThis expression can be simplified when $N_1=N_2$:\n$$\\nu\\approx\\frac{s^4_{\\triangle\\overline{X}}}{\\nu^{-1}_1s^4_{\\overline{X}_1}+\\nu^{-1}_2s^4_{\\overline{X}_2}}$$\n\nHere, $\\nu _{i}=N_{i}-1$ is the degrees of freedom associated with the $i$-th variance estimate.\n\nThe statistic is approximately from the t-distribution since we have an approximation of the chi-square distribution. This approximation is better done when both $N_{1}$ and $N_2$ are larger than 5.\n\n\n## Example\n\nThe t-score, assuming the distributions of gene expression with and without mutation have unequal variances, is computed by using the following equation:\n\n$$t=\\frac{g_y-g_n}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_y}{N_y}+\\frac{s^2_n}{N_n}}}$$\n\nwhere\n- $g_y$ and $g_n$ are mean gene expression of participants with and without mutation;\n- $N_y$ and $N_n$ are the number of participants in the group with and without mutation;\n- $s^2_y$ and $s^2_n$ are the variance of gene expression for the participants with and without mutation, respectively.\nSince the Somatic mutation table contains information of positive somatic mutation only, the averages and variances needed to compute the t-score are computed as a function $S_y=\\sum_{i=1}^{N_y}g_i$ and $Q_y=\\sum_{i=1}^{N_y}g^2_i$, the sums over the gene expression and squared gene expression for articipants with somatic mutation.\n\nAfter computing $S_y$ and $Q_y$, we can compute the mean and the variance as:\n\n$$g_y=\\frac{S_y}{N_y}$$\n$$s^2_y=\\frac{1}{N_y-1}[Q_y-\\frac{S^2_y}{N_y}]$$\n\nTo compute $S_n$ and $Q_n$, we first compute the sums of the gene expression and squeared gene expression using all the samples and then substract $S_y$ and $Q_y$. The following query uses this approach to compute the necessary variances and means, and then computes t-score. The t-score is only computed if the variances are greater than zero and if the number of participants in each group is greater than a user defined threshold (e.g., 10).\n\n\n## Statistical test\n\nOnce $t$ and $\\nu$ have been computed, these statistics can be used with the t-distribution to test one of two possible null hypotheses:\n\n- that the two population means are equal, in which a two-tailed test is applied; or\n- that one of the population means is greater than or equal to the other, in which a one-tailed test is applied.\n\nThe approximate degrees of freedom are real numbers $\\nu \\in \\mathbb {R} ^{+}$ and used as such in statistics-oriented software, whereas they are rounded down to the nearest integer in spreadsheets.\n\n## Advantages and limitations\n\nWelch's t-test is more robust than Student's t-test and maintains type I error rates close to nominal for unequal variances and for unequal sample sizes under normality. Furthermore, the power of Welch's t-test comes close to that of Student's t-test, even when the population variances are equal and sample sizes are balanced. Welch's t-test can be generalized to more than 2-samples, which is more robust than one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nIt is not recommended to pre-test for equal variances and then choose between Student's t-test or Welch's t-test. Rather, Welch's t-test can be applied directly and without any substantial disadvantages to Student's t-test as noted above. Welch's t-test remains robust for skewed distributions and large sample sizes. Reliability decreases for skewed distributions and smaller samples, where one could possibly perform Welch's t-test"}

Detail of the test can be found the following link: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch's_t-test)\n\nTo describe the implementation of the test using BigQuery, we will use Gene expresion data of a user defined gene and the precense or absence of somatic mutation of a user defined gene. This data is read from a BigQuery table in the pancancer-atlas dataset.\n\n## Authenticate with Google (IMPORTANT)\n\nThe first step is to authorize access to BigQuery and the Google Cloud.

This information is extracted from the 'pancancer-atlas.Filtered.MC3_MAF_V5_one_per_tumor_sample' table, available in pancancer-atlas dataset. Notice that we only use samples in which FILTER = 'PASS'.\n\nIn [5]:\n\n```\n\n```\n\nAt this point we can take a look at the combined data (Gene expression and Somatic mutation) by using a simple LEFT JOIN command.

BigQuery to Compute statistical association\n\nThe T-score (T), assuming the distributions of gene expression with and without mutation have unequal variances, is computed by using the following equation:\n$$\nT = \\frac{ \\bar{g}_y - \\bar{g}_n }{\\sqrt{ \\frac{s_y^2}{N_y} + \\frac{s_n^2}{N_n}  }   }\n$$\nwhere\n\n- $\\bar{g}_y$ and $\\bar{g}_n$ are mean gene expression of participants with and without mutation.\n- $N_y$ and $N_n$ are the number of participants in the group with and without mutation.\n- $s_y^2$ and $s_n^2$ are the variance of gene expression for the participants with and without mutation, respectively.\n\nSince the Somatic mutation table contains information of positive somatic mutation only, the averages and variances needed to compute the $T$ score are computed as a function $S_y=\\sum_{i=1}^{N_y}{g_i}$ and $Q_y=\\sum_{i=1}^{N_y}{g_i^2}$, the summs over the gene expression and squared gene expression for articipants with somatic mutation. The following query string computes $S_y$ and $Q_y$:\n\nIn [9]:\n\n```\n\n```\n\nAfter computing $S_y$ and $Q_y$ we can compute the mean and the variance as :\n$$\n\\bar{g}_y =\\frac{S_y}{N_y} \\\\\ns_y^2 = (N_y-1)^{-1} \\left[ Q_y - \\frac{S_y^2}{ N_y} \\right]\n$$\nTo compute $S_n$ and $Q_n$, we first compute the sums of the gene expression and squeared gene expression using all the samples and then substract $S_y$ and $Q_y$. The following query uses this approach to compute the necessary variances and means, and then computes $T$ score. The $T$ score is only computed if the variances are greater than zero and if the number of participants in each group is greater than a user defined threshold.\n\nIn [10]:\n\n```\n\n in runQuery ... \n    the results for this query were previously cached \n```\n\nOut[10]:\n\n|      |   Ny |   Nn |    avg_y |    avg_n |    tscore |\n| ---: | ---: | ---: | -------: | -------: | --------: |\n|    0 |  248 |  261 | 2.495134 | 2.894686 | 24.426213 |\n\nTo test our implementation we can use the 'ttest_ins' function available in python:\n\nIn [12]:\n\n```\n\n          DRG2      \n          mean count\nTP53                \nNO    2.894686   261\nYES   2.495134   248\nTtest_indResult(statistic=24.426213134587776, pvalue=4.38554327085175e-84)\n```"}

Introduction to Copy Number Variations (CNVs)**\n\nCopy number variations (CNVs) are changes in the genome where regions have altered numbers of DNA segments. These variations include amplifications or deletions, significantly impacting genetic diversity and disease progression, particularly in cancer.\n\n#### **2. The Role of CNVs in Cancer**\n\nCNVs can drive cancer progression by amplifying oncogenes or deleting tumor suppressor genes, affecting gene dosage and cellular control mechanisms.\n\n#### **3. TCGA-KIRC Project Overview**\n\nThe TCGA Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) project offers crucial CNV data to enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of kidney cancer.\n\n#### **4. CytoBands and Their Genomic Significance**\n\nCytoBands are chromosomal regions identified by staining patterns that help localize genetic functions and structural features.\n\n#### **5. Data Sources for CNV Analysis**\n\n- **TCGA CNV Data**: Provides genomic copy number changes in cancer tissues.\n- **Mitelman Database (CytoBands_hg38)**: Offers detailed cytoband data for mapping CNVs to chromosomes.\n\n#### **6. CNV Categories and Their Implications in Cancer**\n\n- **Amplifications** (>3 copies): Lead to oncogene overexpression, accelerating tumor growth.\n- **Gains** (=3 copies): Cause subtle changes in gene dosage, potentially enhancing cancer progression.\n- **Homozygous Deletions** (0 copies): Result in the loss of both copies of tumor suppressor genes, promoting tumor development.\n- **Heterozygous Deletions** (1 copy): Reduce the dosage of key regulatory genes, contributing to tumor progression.\n- **Normal Diploid** (2 copies): Maintain standard genomic copies, serving as a baseline for comparative analysis.\n\n#### **7. Methodology for Determining Overlaps**\n\nTo localize CNVs within specific cytobands, we use:\n\n\\[ \\text{Overlap} = \\max(0, \\min(\\text{end\\_pos}, \\text{hg38\\_stop}) - \\max(\\text{start\\_pos}, \\text{hg38\\_start})) \\]\n\nThis formula ensures that the overlap measurement is the actual intersected length of the CNV and cytoband segments. It uses:\n- `\\min(\\text{end\\_pos}, \\text{hg38\\_stop})` to find the smallest endpoint between the CNV segment and the cytoband.\n- `\\max(\\text{start\\_pos}, \\text{hg38\\_start})` to find the largest start point between the CNV segment and the cytoband.\n- The `max(0, ...)` function ensures that the overlap cannot be negative, which would indicate no actual overlap.\n\n\n#### **8. Conclusion**\n\nAnalyzing CNVs is crucial for understanding cancer genetics and developing targeted therapies. Integrating CNV analysis with traditional markers enhances our insights into tumor biology."}

The reference allele is the variant of a gene that is most common in a population or considered the \"standard\" sequence. In genomic studies, this reference sequence serves as a baseline to identify variations or mutations in an individual's genome.\n\n## Characteristics\n- **Alleles**: In a diploid organism, each individual has two alleles at each locus—one inherited from the mother and one from the father. In the case of a homozygous reference genotype, both of these alleles match the reference sequence.\n- **Genotype Representation**: Homozygous reference genotypes are typically represented as `0/0` or `0|0`, where `0` denotes the reference allele. The slashes (`/`) or pipes (`|`) are used to separate the two alleles.\n- **No Variation**: The hom_RR genotype indicates that there is no variation from the reference sequence at this specific locus in the individual's genome. This is the opposite of a **homozygous alternate genotype** (hom_AA), where both alleles differ from the reference, or a **heterozygous genotype** (het_RA), where one allele matches the reference and the other does not.\n\n## Biological Significance\nHomozygous reference genotypes are crucial in understanding genetic variation within populations. By comparing individual genotypes to the reference genome:\n- Researchers can identify loci that are conserved across a population (where most individuals are hom_RR).\n- It helps in pinpointing specific loci where mutations occur, potentially leading to genetic diseases or contributing to phenotypic diversity.\n\n## Use in Genomic Analysis\nIn genomic studies, identifying homozygous reference genotypes is a critical step in filtering and analyzing genetic data. It provides a baseline to:\n- **Calculate mutation frequencies**: By determining how often a specific locus deviates from the reference genotype.\n- **Perform association studies**: To link genetic variants with particular traits or diseases.\n- **Understand evolutionary conservation**: Hom_RR loci may indicate regions of the genome under strong evolutionary pressure to remain unchanged.\n\n## Example Scenario\nConsider a genomic variant dataset where each record contains information about a specific locus:\n- If a sample's genotype for a given locus is `0/0`, this sample is considered to have a homozygous reference genotype at that locus.\n- This status can be used to count the number of hom_RR genotypes across all loci for a given individual, or to compare the frequency of hom_RR genotypes between populations.\n\n## Summary\nThe homozygous reference genotype plays a foundational role in genetic analysis, serving as a benchmark for identifying genetic variations. It is a key concept for understanding the genetic makeup of individuals and populations in relation to a reference genome.\n"}

Geospatial Intersection of Postal Code Areas and Census Block Groups\nWe are using two geographical units:\n- **ZIP Code Areas**: Represented by geometries from the ZIP code boundaries dataset.\n- **Census Block Groups**: Represented by geometries from the national census block groups dataset.\n\n### Key Calculation:\n- The method calculates the area of overlap between each ZIP code's geometry and each block group's geometry.\n- The ratio of this intersection area to the total block group area is computed as the **overlap ratio**.\n\nThis overlap ratio represents the proportion of a block group that falls within a given ZIP code.\n\n## 2. Bank Location Distribution Based on Overlap Ratio\nThe next step involves distributing the number of bank locations to the overlapping census block groups based on the calculated overlap ratio.\n\n### Key Calculation:\n- For each block group, the number of bank locations is proportionally assigned based on the overlap size. The total number of bank locations in a ZIP code is distributed to the block groups using the overlap ratio.\n\nThis provides the number of bank institutions for each block group, adjusted for the overlap with ZIP code areas.\n\n## 3.

Its analysis can reveal critical information like how well your site converts new visitors to users and which items and features are associated with users coming back.

It is called N days because we define the length of each period. For example, with N=7 day retention, if User A becomes part of our cohort of interest on day 0 and returns to the product day 5 and day 15, they are counted as retained for week 1 (1–7 days) and week 3 (15–21 days) but not week 2 (8–14 days).\n\n\nb) For Unbounded Retention, a user is counted as retained each week so long as their most recent product contact was after the week. For example, if User A becomes part of the cohort on day 0 and last returned to the site on day 21, they will be counted as retained in week 1 (1–7 days), week 2 (8–14 days), and week 3 (15–21 days) but not week 4 (22–28 days).\n\nBy calculating these metrics, companies can evaluate how well their products hold users’ interests.

The average sales should be computed as the total spend divided by the total number of orders. Please analyze and report the differences in average sales across the RFM segments", "external_knowledge": "# Introduction to the RFM Model\n\nThe RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model segments and scores customers based on three key dimensions:\n\n• Recency (R): How long it has been since the customer’s last purchase. A lower R score (e.g., R = 1) indicates a very recent purchase, while a higher R score (e.g., R = 5) indicates a longer time since the last purchase.\n\n• Frequency (F): How often the customer purchases within a given time period. A lower F score (e.g., F = 1) signifies that the customer buys very frequently, whereas a higher F score (e.g., F = 5) indicates less frequent purchasing.\n\n• Monetary (M): The total amount of money the customer spends. A lower M score (e.g., M = 1) indicates higher overall spending, while a higher M score (e.g., M = 5) signifies lower spending over the measured period.\n\nEach customer’s R, F, and M scores are determined by their respective percentiles when compared to other customers. By concatenating the three scores, you get an “RFM cell”—for instance, a customer with R=1, F=5, and M=2 would fall into the 152 segment.\n\n# RFM Segmentation Calculation\n\nAfter scoring customers on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, the next step is to group them into segments that require different marketing or sales strategies. Typically:\n\n1. Determine each customer’s recency score (R) from 1 to 5 (1 = very recent purchase, 5 = not recent).  \n2. Determine each customer’s frequency score (F) from 1 to 5 (1 = most frequent purchases, 5 = least frequent).  \n3. Determine each customer’s monetary score (M) from 1 to 5 (1 = highest spending, 5 = lowest spending).  \n4. Concatenate these three scores into an RFM score (e.g., 153, 514).\n\nBy analyzing the distribution of RFM scores and placing them into buckets—for example, “Champions,” “Loyal Customers,” “At Risk,” “Lost,” etc.—you can tailor marketing, sales, and retention strategies to maximize the potential of each segment. \n\nFor instance, a “Champion” (R=1, F=1, M=1) is a recent, frequent, and high-spending user who is highly valuable to your business, whereas a “Lost” customer (e.g., R=5, F=5, M=5) may require re-engagement offers or might no longer be cost-effective to target. Different segments can thus be prioritized based on their profitability and likelihood of responding positively to marketing efforts.\n\n## RFM Segmentation Logic\n\nCustomers are assigned to specific segments (RFM Buckets) based on a combination of their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores. The segmentation logic is as follows:\n\n- **Champions**: Customers who have made a recent purchase, with high frequency and high monetary value. These are considered the most valuable customers.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 4.\n\n- **Can't Lose Them**: Previously frequent and high-spending customers who have not made a recent purchase. These customers are at risk of leaving and need attention.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 2.\n\n- **Hibernating**: Customers whose last purchase was a while ago, with low to moderate frequency and spending. These customers might have lost interest in the products.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 3 and 6.\n\n- **Lost**: Customers who have not purchased in a long time and have low frequency and monetary value. These customers are likely lost.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 4 or 5 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 10.\n\n- **Loyal Customers**: Customers who are frequent buyers with decent spending levels, and they have made a purchase relatively recently. These customers are likely to be very loyal.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 2 or 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 1 and 4.\n\n- **Needs Attention**: Customers whose purchase frequency and spending are moderate. They haven't bought very recently, but they could be incentivized to become more active.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 6.\n\n- **Recent Users**: Customers who made a purchase recently, but their frequency and spending are moderate. These are relatively new or inconsistent buyers.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 8.\n\n- **Potential Loyalists**: Customers who show potential to become loyal customers. They have good frequency and monetary scores, and they have made recent purchases. With the right engagement, they could become loyal customers.\n  - Criteria:\n    - Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 6.\n    - OR Recency = 2 and Frequency + Monetary score between 5 and 8.\n\n- **Price Sensitive**: Customers who have made recent purchases but tend to spend less, indicating they may be more sensitive to price.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 1 and Frequency + Monetary score between 9 and 10.\n\n- **Promising**: These customers exhibit high potential with decent frequency and monetary scores, and they could become more valuable over time.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 2 and Frequency + Monetary score between 9 and 10.\n\n- **About to Sleep**: Customers whose frequency and spending are low, and their last purchase was some time ago. These customers are likely to become inactive.\n  - Criteria: Recency = 3 and Frequency + Monetary score between 7 and 10.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis segmentation logic groups customers based on their behavior in terms of when they last purchased (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much they spend (Monetary). By understanding which group a customer belongs to, organizations can tailor marketing strategies to engage the right audience more effectively, improving customer retention and maximizing value.\n"}

This method is especially useful for determining flight distances between airports located in different cities around the world.\n\n## City and Coordinate Extraction\n\nFor each flight, the following data is obtained:\n\n- **Departure city** (referred to as `from_city`) and its geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).\n- **Arrival city** (referred to as `to_city`) and its geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude).\n\nThe coordinates are extracted as decimal values, with longitude and latitude represented in degrees. This ensures that trigonometric operations can be applied during the distance calculation.\n\n## Haversine Formula\n\nThe Haversine formula is used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere using their latitude and longitude. The formula is given as:\n\n\\[\nd = 2r \\cdot \\arcsin\\left(\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1) \\cdot \\cos(\\phi_2) \\cdot \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\lambda}{2}\\right)}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( d \\) is the distance between the two points (in kilometers).\n- \\( r \\) is the radius of the Earth (approximately 6371 km).\n- \\( \\phi_1 \\) and \\( \\phi_2 \\) are the latitudes of the departure and arrival points, respectively, in radians.\n- \\( \\Delta \\phi = \\phi_2 - \\phi_1 \\) is the difference in latitudes.\n- \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) are the longitudes of the departure and arrival points, respectively, in radians.\n- \\( \\Delta \\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1 \\) is the difference in longitudes.\n\n### Conversion to Radians\n\nSince the input coordinates are in degrees, they must be converted to radians before applying the Haversine formula. This conversion is done using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n\\]\n\n## Symmetry of Routes\n\nTo identify unique flight routes between two cities, we standardize the order of cities in each route. Specifically, we ensure that the lexicographically smaller city name is always listed as the first city (`city1`), and the larger city is listed as the second city (`city2`). This ensures that a flight from City A to City B is treated the same as a flight from City B to City A.\n\n## Average Route Distance\n\nOnce the distances for all flights between two cities are computed, the average distance for each city pair is calculated by summing the distances and dividing by the total number of flights between those cities:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Distance} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{Flight Distances}}{\\text{Number of Flights}}\n\\]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis method of flight route distance calculation provides a reliable way to determine the great-circle distance between cities based on the coordinates of their respective airports.
